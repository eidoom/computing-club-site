Welcome to the online manifestation of the IPPP Computing Club! Here you'll find [information about upcoming sessions]({{< ref "updates" >}}) and [write-ups of previous sessions]({{< ref "sessions" >}}).

#### Mailing list

To join the mailing list, please send a message to majordomo@durham.ac.uk with the following text in the message body: `subscribe ph-complunchclub`, which you can do by <a href="mailto:majordomo@durham.ac.uk?body=subscribe ph-complunchclub">clicking here</a>.

You might then have to follow authorisation instructions which may be emailed back to you.
Ensure all emails you send have a plain text body; authorisation will not work with HTML emails.
After authorisation or otherwise, you will receive a confirmation email.

[Ryan]({{< ref "ryan-moodie" >}})'s in charge of the mailing list; speak to him if there are any problems.

#### Website

[Ryan]({{< ref "ryan-moodie" >}})'s in charge of the website, the [source of which can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/eidoom/computing-club-site); speak to him if you would like write permission. Alternatively, fork and submit a pull request.

There's a [guide]({{< ref "sessions/static-website-generation-with-hugo.md" >}}) for adding posts.

We also have [a dynamic website](http://shrieking-asylum-67258.herokuapp.com/) from [a previous project]({{< ref "updates/dynamic-websites-with-the-men-stack/" >}}) that you're welcome to use too.
However, the website you're on now is currently our primary resource.

#### Meetings

**1300 Thursdays** in **OC218** (James Stirling Conference Room in Ogden East).
The COVID capacity of the room is 44, so there should be no practical limit on physical attendance.
Tea, coffee, and biscuits are provided.
Please feel welcome to bring your lunch.
The format is hybrid; the video conference link is circulated over the mailing list.

##### Ideas for improving the Galton board software

* Mass of balls
* Size of balls
* Size of pins
* Width of barriers
* Fix lag
	* Due to N=300?
* Deploy on Pis from GitHub repo, automate updates
* Get light gates working
* Somehow show effect of large N
	* If performance is an issue, pre-calculate
* Add option to drip feed balls into simulation
* Check dependencies
* Add sliders to change physical parameters
* Change gravity on the fly? As a vector? Accelerometers in Pis?
* Maybe: allow barriers to be drawn in by hand
* Consider using some more up-to-date libraries? Touch screen interactivity, GUI, physics?
* Make it into a webapp? (not to replace Pi software, to provide in addition)

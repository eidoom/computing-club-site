      <description>Thank you to Sofie for running the session today on a first introduction to C++. Judging by the engagement of the audience, this was a very useful meeting for everyone! The slides will appear soon on here.
Apologies to those who couldn&amp;rsquo;t make the meeting today; we tried to record it, but had to give up after ten minutes of failure. Ironic, I know, that we were unsuccessful in using a computing technology here&amp;hellip; Hopefully the slides will provide a taster in substitute.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Next week, Hitham will be continuing in the vein of &lt;code&gt;C++&lt;/code&gt; programming by covering the most difficult and important part of it: basic debugging in &lt;code&gt;C++&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Hi,
Thank you again to Yannick for the two part shell and git introduction he has run the past two weeks. I hope the idea of the (Linux) shell as a development environment and the version control workflow provided by git started to make sense for everyone after a chance to put it into practice. Please feel welcome to continue to play around with this website as a sandbox.
Next week, Sofie will very kindly be running an introduction to programming in C++.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I may not be able to make the meeting myself so am relying on &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.dmaitre.phyip3.dur.ac.uk/computing-club/authors/tommy/&#34;&gt;Tommy&lt;/a&gt; to pick up the refreshments (thanks!).&lt;/p&gt;

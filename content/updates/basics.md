the use of Git for version control of software.

The slides etc can be found in [Yannick's repository](https://gitlab.com/yannickulrich/computing-toolkit)
which will be live by tomorrow, and the session will also involve
hands-on work involving [the computing club website](https://notes.dmaitre.phyip3.dur.ac.uk/computing-club/).

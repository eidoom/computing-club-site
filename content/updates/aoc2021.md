Every year, [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) (AoC) publishes a coding challenge each day of the Advent calendar.
The problems are fun and Christmassy, what's not to love?
It's also a great way to practice coding in a language you want to become more familiar with.
The problems start out fairly easy, with each subsequent day generally increasing in difficulty.

For the two December meetings, 2 Dec and 9 Dec, I propose we spend the hour trying out the puzzles together and comparing our solutions :)

They get released daily from 1 Dec, so feel free to get a head start with the first puzzle on the Wednesday.
I'll set up a Computing Club AoC leaderboard for us for those who want a bit of competitivity.
After you [log in](https://adventofcode.com/2021/auth/login), you can join it [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021/leaderboard/private) with the join code that I'll distribute by email.

Note that 9 Dec will be our last meeting before the Winter break.

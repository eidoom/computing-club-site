Historically, the IPPP has held a weekly lunchtime Computing Club. This
year we'd like to invite everyone in Physics who's interested to join.
All career levels are welcome.

We usually run informal seminar style sessions with some open sessions
for people to crowd-source solutions to their coding problems. You can
see some examples of previous meeting topics at

* https://notes.dmaitre.phyip3.dur.ac.uk/computing-club/topics/
* https://shrieking-asylum-67258.herokuapp.com/topics

We also run longer projects for fun when there's interest.

To join the mailing list, please send a message to
majordomo@durham.ac.uk with the following text in the message body:
subscribe ph-complunchclub
You then have to follow the authorisation instructions which will be
emailed back to you. Ensure all emails you send have a plain text body;
authorisation will not work with HTML emails.

If everyone who wants to join fills in their general availability
(ignore the specific dates and treat as weekly availability) on this
poll
https://doodle.com/poll/g4rnn55dgxtrt6nd?utm_source=poll&utm_medium=link
I'll pick the best time for everyone and book an appropriately sized
room for us. I'll be in touch with you all via the ph-complunchclub
mailing list once that's sorted.

Looking forward to our first meeting!

Every year, [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) publishes a coding challenge each day of the Advent calendar.
The problems are fun and Christmassy, what's not to love?
It's also a great way to practice coding in a language you want to become more familiar with.

For the two December meetings, 2 Dec and 9 Dec, I propose we spend the hour trying out the puzzles together and comparing our solutions :)

Note that 9 Dec will be our last meeting before the Christmas break.

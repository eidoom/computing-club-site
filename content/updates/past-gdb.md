Apologies for all the technical difficulties we encountered today---at least we successfully debugged them!

Thanks to [Hitham]({{< ref "hitham-hassan" >}}) for [today's session on `gdb`]({{< ref "gdb-intro" >}}).

The [slides for the talk last week]({{< ref "sessions/cpp-intro" >}}) by [Sofie]({{< ref "sofie-erner" >}}) are now available.

Next week, we'll be trying out [some festive coding challenges]({{< ref "updates/aoc2021" >}}).

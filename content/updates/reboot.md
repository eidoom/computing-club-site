Welcome to our new members and the regulars!

I've booked out OC218 (Ogden East Conference Room) for Thursdays at
1300 for the hour. We'll have our first meeting next Thursday, 28 Oct.

OC218 has a capacity of 44 people, so everyone will be able to attend
in person if they wish to. For those wishing to join virtually, I'll
set up an Owl and you can connect through the Zoom room circulated through the mailing list.

In our first meeting we can all introduce ourselves and discuss how
we'd like to proceed with the club and the content of following
sessions.

This is a lunchtime club, so please do take food if you want to!

Note that there's no expectation of ability or prior knowledge, so everyone please feel very welcome to come
along.

Not that further enticement is required, but tea and coffee will be
provided!

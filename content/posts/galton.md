The code for the Raspberry Pi Galton board simulation is now on github.  It's currently entirely David Grellscheid's work so I don't intend to make the repository public, but anyone who'd like to work on improving the code is welcome to do so -- just [send me an email](mailto:james.c.whitehead@durham.ac.uk) with your github username and I'll add you as a collaborator.

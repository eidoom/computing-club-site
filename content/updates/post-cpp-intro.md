Thank you to Sofie for running the session today on a first introduction to `C++`.
Judging by the engagement of the audience, this was a very useful meeting for everyone!
The slides will appear soon on here.

Apologies to those who couldn't make the meeting today; we tried to record it, but had to give up after ten minutes of failure.
Ironic, I know, that we were unsuccessful in using a computing technology here...
Hopefully the slides will provide a taster in substitute.

Next week, Hitham will be continuing in the vein of `C++` programming by covering the most difficult and important part of it: basic debugging in `C++` with `gdb`.

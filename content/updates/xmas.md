Today was our last meeting of 2021.
I hope the computing club sessions have been useful and enjoyable for everyone this term, and that you now have a healthy addiction to [Advent of Code]({{< ref "aoc21a" >}}).

We'll be resuming in January with the new term (week starting 10 Jan), exact time and location to be determined.
Hopefully those who want to can still meet in person with the hybrid format, depending on university restrictions by then.
In our first returning session, we'll have one last look at Advent of Code 2021 and find out who won the leaderboard!

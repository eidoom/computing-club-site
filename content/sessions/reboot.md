A quick summary of our first meeting.

Over the next few weeks, we'll cover the following [topics]({{< ref "topics" >}}):

* [computing environment basics]({{< ref "toolkit" >}}) ([Yannick]({{< ref "yannick-ulrich" >}}) - next week)
    * shell
    * git
* Python package management ([Ryan]({{< ref "ryan-moodie" >}}))
* [C++ introduction]({{< ref "sessions/cpp-intro" >}}) (~~[Ryan]({{< ref "ryan-moodie" >}})~~ [Sofie]({{< ref "sofie-erner" >}}))
* Continuous integration and deployment ([Hitham]({{< ref "hitham-hassan" >}}))

On the format, most sessions will loosely involve someone (or a group)
presenting some prepared (but informal) content over around half an
hour, with remaining time for discussion and where possible hands-on
playing with code.

We have the two websites

* https://notes.dmaitre.phyip3.dur.ac.uk/computing-club/
* https://shrieking-asylum-67258.herokuapp.com/

which can both be used according to preference to record links or
information about previous sessions and for pedagogy.

There's interest in doing some project work.

I hope the mixed virtual/physical platform worked well enough for
everyone. Please contact me if you have any comments on this.

One thing I forgot to mention - I'd like to hand over to someone else
to run the club at the end of this term (I'll be thesis writing after
the winter break). If anyone's interested, please get in touch.

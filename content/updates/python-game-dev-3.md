Next week's game dev session is inspired by Raspberry Pi's [Wireframe](https://wireframe.raspberrypi.org/), a magazine about game development.
You can download the issue we'll be using for free as a pdf from their [site](https://wireframe.raspberrypi.org/issues/24).
The Donkey Kong article is on page 40.
They've published their code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Wireframe-Magazine/Wireframe-24), too.

A reminder that tomorrow Hitham will be introducing us to basic `gdb` debugging of `C++`, Thurs 25 Nov 1300 GMT in OC218 and via Zoom.
I'll most likely be joining virtually myself tomorrow.

The code and slides (to follow) for the session can be found at [`Hitham2496/Computing-Talks`](https://github.com/Hitham2496/Computing-Talks).

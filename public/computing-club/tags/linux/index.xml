      <description>I thought I&amp;rsquo;d better record some of the stuff I did to address these issues.
Updating Raspian from Jessie to Stretch This was simply a matter of changing the OS version in the sources files and running an update:
sudo sed -i &amp;quot;s/jessie/stretch/g&amp;quot; /etc/apt/sources.list sudo sed -i &amp;quot;s/jessie/stretch/g&amp;quot; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/raspi.list sudo apt update sudo apt -y dist-upgrade  I also had to say yes or no to some prompts about changing configuration files to the new default or keeping the old customized one.</description>

      <description>Today was the first day of Celebrate Science 2019. Whilst taking a break from running our exhibit, I had a look at our Pis.
Meet the Pis There are nine in total.
Four have stands in the horizontal/landscape configuration. Yesterday, Henry and I found that three of these run the NuOdyssey game locally. Apparently it was written by somebody called Sunil, anybody know that story? You just start the browser which automatically brings up the game as its starting page.</description>

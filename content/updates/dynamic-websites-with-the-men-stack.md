Hi all!

today's computing club will be in OC103 at 1pm.

Abstract by Joey:

IPPPlog is a blog intended for use by the computing club, to update people on any fun side projects you may be doing, as well as propose topics etc. This website is dynamic, using a MEN stack (MongoDB database, ExpressJS framework, written with NodeJS). I will go through the general way it all works and some specifics if people have questions. This should be a easier system than the Hugo one as one just creates an account like they would on Facebook rather than being a git collaborator. Hugo is fantastic for quickly making static websites but cannot really compete in the realm of dynamic content (such as blogs).

See you later,

Giuseppe

      <description>A reminder that tomorrow Hitham will be introducing us to basic gdb debugging of C++, Thurs 25 Nov 1300 GMT in OC218 and via Zoom. I&amp;rsquo;ll most likely be joining virtually myself tomorrow.
The code and slides (to follow) for the session can be found at Hitham2496/Computing-Talks.</description>

      <description>Thank you to Sofie for running the session today on a first introduction to C++. Judging by the engagement of the audience, this was a very useful meeting for everyone! The slides will appear soon on here.
Apologies to those who couldn&amp;rsquo;t make the meeting today; we tried to record it, but had to give up after ten minutes of failure. Ironic, I know, that we were unsuccessful in using a computing technology here&amp;hellip; Hopefully the slides will provide a taster in substitute.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Next week, Hitham will be continuing in the vein of &lt;code&gt;C++&lt;/code&gt; programming by covering the most difficult and important part of it: basic debugging in &lt;code&gt;C++&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;gdb&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

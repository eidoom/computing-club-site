I hope everyone enjoyed having a go with the first couple of challenges of [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) today.
It's good to see almost everyone having two gold stars on the leaderboard already!
By the end of Advent, the leaderboard winner will, of course, be awarded with ultimate prestige.

We'll continue with these next week, by which time seven more puzzles will be unlocked.

See [the previous update]({{< ref "updates/aoc2021" >}}) for a reminder of login instructions.

It will be fun to compare solutions, so we can record links to the solution repositories of everyone who wants to share here.
Please feel welcome to add yours to this list.

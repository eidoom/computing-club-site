Hi,

Thank you again to Yannick for the two part [shell and git introduction]({{< ref "toolkit" >}}) he has run the past two weeks.
I hope the idea of the (Linux) shell as a development environment and the version control workflow provided by `git` started to make sense for everyone after a chance to put it into practice.
Please feel welcome to continue to play around with this website as a sandbox.

Next week, Sofie will very kindly be running an introduction to programming in C++.

I may not be able to make the meeting myself so am relying on [Tommy]({{< ref "tommy" >}}) to pick up the refreshments (thanks!).

Ryan

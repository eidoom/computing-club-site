      <description>Apologies for all the technical difficulties we encountered today&amp;mdash;at least we successfully debugged them!
Thanks to Hitham for today&amp;rsquo;s session on gdb.
The slides for the talk last week by Sofie are now available.
Next week, we&amp;rsquo;ll be trying out some festive coding challenges.</description>

      <description>A reminder that tomorrow Hitham will be introducing us to basic gdb debugging of C++, Thurs 25 Nov 1300 GMT in OC218 and via Zoom. I&amp;rsquo;ll most likely be joining virtually myself tomorrow.
The code and slides (to follow) for the session can be found at Hitham2496/Computing-Talks.</description>

      <description>Thank you to Sofie for running the session today on a first introduction to C++. Judging by the engagement of the audience, this was a very useful meeting for everyone! The slides will appear soon on here.
Apologies to those who couldn&amp;rsquo;t make the meeting today; we tried to record it, but had to give up after ten minutes of failure. Ironic, I know, that we were unsuccessful in using a computing technology here&amp;hellip; Hopefully the slides will provide a taster in substitute.</description>

      <description>Hi,
Thank you again to Yannick for the two part shell and git introduction he has run the past two weeks. I hope the idea of the (Linux) shell as a development environment and the version control workflow provided by git started to make sense for everyone after a chance to put it into practice. Please feel welcome to continue to play around with this website as a sandbox.
Next week, Sofie will very kindly be running an introduction to programming in C++.</description>

      <description>Today was the first day of Celebrate Science 2019. While taking a break from running our exhibit, I had a look at our Pis.
There are nine in total. Four have stands in the horizontal/landscape configuration. Yesterday, Henry and I found that three of these run the NuOdyssey game locally. (Apparently it was written by somebody called Sunil, anybody know that story?) You just start the browser which automatically brings up the game as its starting page.</description>

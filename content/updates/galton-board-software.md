Hi everyone,

in today's session we are going to *very briefly* have a look at the repo with the software used for outreach (Galton board).

Afterwards there will be plenty of time to discuss other things, so if you have any computing problem please bring it along!
We might help solving it and it's probably useful for everyone to learn something new <i class="far fa-smile"></i>

We are meeting in OC103 at 1pm.

See you later,

Giuseppe
